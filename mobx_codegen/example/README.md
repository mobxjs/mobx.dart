# MobX CodeGen examples

Shows [an example](lib/src/generator_example.dart) of using the MobX code generator. Note that
you do need to run the **build_runner** command at the root of your flutter project.

```shell
pub run build_runner build
```

If you want to keep it _running in the background_ as you make changes,
use:

```shell
pub run build_runner watch
```
