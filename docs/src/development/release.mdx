# Release Guidelines

If you are a developer on the MobX project, here are few guidelines that will help in your journey. These apply to all the packages: `mobx`, `mobx_codegen`, `flutter_mobx`.

### 1. `pubspec.yaml`

- Use the [semantic versioning policy](https://dart.dev/tools/pub/versioning) to update the version in `pubspec.yaml`.
- Say you are updating from `0.1.0` to `0.2.0`, then update the `version` field in `pubspec.yaml`:

```yaml
version: 0.2.0
```

### 2. Expose version

- Expose the updated version of `pubspec.yaml` to the library `.dart` file by running the appropriate command:

```bash
./tool/expose_version.dart <package_name>
```

### 3. Changelog

- Update the `CHANGELOG.md` file to include the changes introduced in the new version. Normally you would do this by adding a new bullet point for the version and follow the template from earlier versions.
- If the changes are minimal, you can also append the change to an earlier bullet point but include the new version as a range. For example, the changes in `0.3.2+3` were minimal, so we added it as a range from the earlier version.

```markdown
## 0.3.0 - 0.3.2+3
```

### 4. Publish

Run the command `flutter packages pub publish` in the package folder. Assuming you have done all of the earlier steps, this should be just a matter of hitting the `y` key and publishing.

```
$> flutter packages pub publish
Publishing mobx 0.3.3+2 to https://pub.dartlang.org:
