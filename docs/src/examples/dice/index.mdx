In this example, we will build a fun dice app. You can make the dice roll at the tap of a button and a random count is generated with every roll of dice.

## Store setup

The `DiceCounter` store is quite simple. It keeps a track of dice values and the total count. Below is how it looks:

- Generate `dice_counter.g.dart` file using `build_runner` and this must be imported into the store. Read more about `build_runner` in the _MobX Code Generation library_, <PubBadge name="mobx_codegen" />.

```dart
import 'dart:math';
import 'package:mobx/mobx.dart';

part 'dice_counter.g.dart';

class DiceCounter = _DiceCounter with _$DiceCounter;

abstract class _DiceCounter with Store {
  @observable
  int left = Random().nextInt(6) + 1;

  @observable
  int right = Random().nextInt(6) + 1;

  @observable
  int total;

  @action
  void roll() {
    left = Random().nextInt(6) + 1;
    right = Random().nextInt(6) + 1;
    total = left + right;
  }
}

```

- In the above store `left` and `right` are the dice counts defined with `@observable` annotations and are initialised with a random number ranging from **1** - **6**.
- `total` is also an observable which keeps track of the total count of the dice.
- The action-method `roll()` defined with `@action` annotation is used to update the dice counts every time user taps on the dice.

With the above implementation I was able to keep a track of the left, right and total counts with every user interaction as expected or so I thought 🤔.

I have modified the above `DiceCounter` implementation using `@computed`.

```dart
import 'dart:math';
import 'package:mobx/mobx.dart';

part 'dice_counter.g.dart';

class DiceCounter = _DiceCounter with _$DiceCounter;

abstract class _DiceCounter with Store {
  @observable
  int left = Random().nextInt(6) + 1;

  @observable
  int right = Random().nextInt(6) + 1;

  @computed
  int get total => left + right;

  @action
  void roll() {
    left = Random().nextInt(6) + 1;
    right = Random().nextInt(6) + 1;
  }
}

```

- Now `total` is a computed observable annotated with `@computed`. Computed observables are in-sync every time left or right count is updated.
- The value of `total` is automatically updated when the instance of the store is created so I no longer have the `null` value when I load the app.
- `@computed` does more than that. Now, I do not have to write any additional code like the above in the action-method to update it.

## Integrating the Store with the View

Now that the `DiceCounter` store is ready, it's time to add it to the `Widget` to see the magic happen. Let's create an instance of our store:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_mobx/flutter_mobx.dart';

import 'dice_counter.dart';

final diceCounter = DiceCounter();

```

The observables and actions from the store can be accessed via the newly created instance `diceCounter` along with the `Observer` widget as shown below:

```dart
class DiceView extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Center(
      child: Column(
        mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
        children: <Widget>[
          Row(
            children: <Widget>[
              Expanded(
                child: FlatButton(
                  child: Observer(
                    builder: (_) =>
                        Image.asset('images/dice${diceCounter.left}.png'),
                  ),
                  onPressed: diceCounter.roll,
                ),
              ),
              Expanded(
                child: FlatButton(
                  child: Observer(
                    builder: (_) =>
                        Image.asset('images/dice${diceCounter.right}.png'),
                  ),
                  onPressed: diceCounter.roll,
                ),
              ),
            ],
          ),
          Padding(
            padding: const EdgeInsets.all(16.0),
            child: Observer(
              builder: (_) => Text(
                'Total ${diceCounter.total}',
                style: TextStyle(
                    fontWeight: FontWeight.bold,
                    color: Colors.black87,
                    fontSize: 16.0,
                    fontFamily: 'Verdana'),
              ),
            ),
          ),
        ],
      ),
    );
  }
}

```
