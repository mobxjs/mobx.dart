## Introduction

MobX is a state-management library that makes it simple to connect the reactive
data of your application with the UI (or any observer). This wiring is
completely automatic and feels very natural. As the application-developer, you
focus purely on what reactive-data needs to be consumed in the UI (and
elsewhere) without worrying about keeping the two in sync.

It's not really magic but it does have some smarts around what is being consumed
(**observables**) and where (**reactions**), and automatically tracks it for
you. When the _observables_ change, all _reactions_ are re-run. What's
interesting is that these reactions can be anything from a simple console log, a
network call to re-rendering the UI.

> MobX has been a very effective library for the JavaScript apps and this port
> to the Dart language aims to bring the same levels of productivity.

## Get Started ðŸš€

Follow along with the [Getting Started Guide](/getting-started) to incorporate
MobX within your Flutter project.

## Go deep

For a deeper coverage of MobX, do check out
[MobX Quick Start Guide](https://www.packtpub.com/web-development/mobx-quick-start-guide).
Although the book uses the JavaScript version of MobX, **almost all** of the
concepts are applicable to Dart and Flutter.
