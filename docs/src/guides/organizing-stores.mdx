# Organizing Stores

The primary purpose of **MobX** is to simplify the management of _Reactive State_ in your application. As your application scales, the amount of state you manage will also increase. This requires some techniques to break down your application state and divvy it up across a set of stores. Of course, putting everything in one `Store` is not prudent, so we apply _divide-and-conquer_ instead.

## General approach to managing Stores

When you look at the UI on the screen, all you see is a flattened graphic. But what escapes your eye is the _Object Model_ that brought it to life on the screen. That _Object Model_ is a tree of `Widgets`, a hierarchy. Just like the UI, think of the Reactive State of your application as a hierarchy of `Stores`.

import storeHierarchy from './store-hierarchy.png';

<img src={storeHierarchy} />

When you are starting out, a single store is enough to get going. As it grows in size, you will see that it is accumulating a lot of additional fields and actions that don't all belong together. It is then time to break it down and move the related observable state and actions to its own `Store`. For example, consider the store below:

```dart
abstract class _MainStore with Store {

  @observable
  String title;

  @observable
  String name;

  @observable
  String email;

  @observable
  String phone;

  @action
  void setTitle(String value) => title = value;

  @action
  void setName(String value) => name = value;

  @action
  void setEmail(String value) => email = value;

  @action
  void setPhone(String value) => phone = value;
}
```

The above `Store` is for an app that has the home page that shows the `title`. There is a form on the second page that accepts the `name`, `email` and `phone` values. Even though it's easier to keep the fields together, it's a good idea to move the form fields to its own `Store`. That forms a nice conceptual boundary and helps in breaking the `MainStore` down.

> Think in terms of **conceptual boundaries** for your stores, aka **Cohesiveness**.

Let's create a sub-store called `PersonDetails` and move the fields into it:

```dart
class PersonDetails = _PersonDetails with _$PersonDetails;

abstract class _PersonDetails with Store {

  @observable
  String name;

  @observable
  String email;

  @observable
  String phone;

  @action
  void setName(String value) => name = value;

  @action
  void setEmail(String value) => email = value;

  @action
  void setPhone(String value) => phone = value;

}
```

The `_MainStore` now looks much simpler to read:

```dart
abstract class _MainStore with Store {

  @observable
  String title;

  final details = PersonDetails();

  @action
  void setTitle(String value) => title = value;
}

```

Note that we are not making the `details` field into an `@observable` as its value is not going to change. The reactive-state that matters is inside the `PersonDetails`, which is already marked `@observbale`.

> ### Store co-ordination
>
> Stores should be made as **independent** as possible with all of their inputs clearly defined. All their **dependencies** should be fed in via **constructor parameters** or through **fields**. Any external communication that needs to happen from the Store should be done via **callbacks**. Adopting this approach improves the **portability** and also simplifies **testing**.

## The triad of Widget - Store - Service

The responsibilities of State management can be clearly demarcated across three entities:

1. **Widget**: this paints the visual representation of the reactive-state
2. **Store**: holds the reactive state of the application
3. **Service**: performs work, which can result in a change to the state. Typically this abstracts the CRUD operations to an API or hides details of any stateless worker process.

The dependency order is always top-down from the **Widget**, through the **Store**, down to the **Service**.

import dependencyOrder from './dependency-order.png';

<img src={dependencyOrder} />

This breakdown has a few advantages:

- The `Widget` layer is primarily stateless and contains a good dose of `Observer` widgets sprinkled wherever the reactive-state is being rendered. You can be as generous as you need to be to with the `Observers` in selectively observing the state.
- The `Store` layer is primarily composed of the `@observable` and `@computed` fields. Additionally, you will have the `@action` methods that mutate the observable state. This layer is primarily meant to add the reactivity you need to render the UI. There is no actual work being performed here besides keeping track of the _reactive-state_.
- The `Service` layer is where you do all the heavy lifting with data. This will include API calls to fetch and send data, format according to the needs of the UI, do data transformations, apply rule-based validation and error checking and so on. All the inputs needed are clearly sent in, making this layer completely stateless!

In short, we have taken cues from the [SOLID](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SOLID) principles and applied them here :-).

> **Single Responsibility** is the most important attribute of this triad pattern.

## Linking Stores

If you organize stores in a hierarchy, you will have a root-Store and then a set of child-Stores that cater to specific features of your application. If the feature is complex, it is possible to have a subtree of Stores. In such a scenario, you will want some kind of communication from the parent to the child stores. There are two common ways of doing this:

1. **Pass the `Parent` into the `Child`**: This way you have direct access to the public interface of the `Parent` and you can use that to observe certain fields or just invoke parent level functionality for certain operations. It is better to pass the parent into the `Child`'s constructor, rather than setting it as a field.

```dart
// parent.dart

final child = Child(parent: this);
```

```dart
// child.dart

class Child {
  Child({this.parent});

  Parent parent;

  void dispose() {
    parent = null;
  }
}
```

> ### Service Locator
>
> If the dependencies between Stores is much more complicated, let's say each Store needs a shared instance of the `ThemeStore`, `PreferencesStore`, `AuthenticationStore`, etc., a better way to manage this is to use the _Service Locator_ pattern. The <PubBadge name="get_it" /> package makes this possible and is worth checking out.

2. **Using callbacks from `Child`**: Rather than tightly coupling the `Parent` with the `Child`, the other option is to have an explicit set of callbacks for the child to communicate with the parent. This is useful when the direction of communication is mostly from `Child` to `Parent`.

```dart
class Parent {

  /* ... */

  void addChild() {
    final child = Child();
    child.onChange = (value) {
      print(value);
    };
  }
}

class Child {

  /* ... */

  void Function(String) onChange;

  void perform() {
    if (onChange != null) {
      onChange('value changed');
    }
  }
}
```

## Store lifetimes

Most stores should be created before rendering the UI. This includes your core application stores, preferences, translations, themes, etc. However, there are cases where a store should exist only for the lifetime of a screen. For example, a `FormWidget` that only needs a store for validation and for loading some dynamic data. Once the `FormWidget` is disposed, the store also goes away.

For such cases, you should create the store in the `initState()` of the `State<FormWidget>` and dispose inside the `State<FormWidget>`'s `dispose()`.

```dart
class FormWidget extends StatefulWidget {
  const FormWidget();

  @override
  _FormWidgetState createState() => _FormWidgetState();
}

class _FormWidgetState extends State<FormWidget> {
  FormStore store;

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();

    store = FormStore();
    store.setupValidations(); // setup some reactions
  }

  @override
  void dispose() {
    store.dispose(); // dispose the reactions
    super.dispose();
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) { /* ... */ }
}

```

## Using Providers to avoid Singletons

The provider-pattern has become a standard way of making the top level stores available across the entire app. It avoids creating a singleton-`Store`, making it easier to use the `Store` as a plain class instance.

Using the <PubBadge name="provider" /> package on pub, you can setup a repository of stores at the App level. Then using the `Provider.of<T>()` API, you can read this value inside your `Widget.build()` methods.

In the example below, we are setting up a store at the app-level:

```dart
class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MultiProvider(
      providers: [
        Provider<MultiCounterStore>(builder: (_) => MultiCounterStore())
      ],
      child: MaterialApp(
        initialRoute: '/',
        theme: ThemeData(
          primarySwatch: Colors.blue,
        ),
        routes: {
          '/': (_) => ExampleList(),
        }..addEntries(
            examples.map((ex) => MapEntry(ex.path, ex.widgetBuilder))),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

Then inside a nested widget, deep inside, you can retrieve the store with the `Provider.of<T>(BuildContext context)` API. You will do this in the `build` method of the `Widget`, where the `context` is available.

```dart
class CounterListPage extends StatelessWidget {
  const CounterListPage();

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    final store = Provider.of<MultiCounterStore>(context);

    return Observer(
        builder: (_) => Column(children: <Widget>[
              RaisedButton(
                onPressed: store.addCounter,
                child: const Text('Add Counter'),
              ),
            ]));
  }
}
```

## Using ProxyProvider with a service

For handling when a store depends on a service, the `ProxyProvider` API can be used

```dart
class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  const MyApp(this._sharedPreferences);

  final SharedPreferences _sharedPreferences;

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) => MultiProvider(
          providers: [
            Provider<PreferencesService>(
              builder: (_) => PreferencesService(_sharedPreferences),
            ),
            ProxyProvider<PreferencesService, SettingsStore>(
                builder: (_, preferencesService, __) =>
                    SettingsStore(preferencesService)),
          ],
          child: Consumer<SettingsStore>(
            builder: (_, store, __) => Observer(
              builder: (_) => MaterialApp(
                initialRoute: '/',
                theme: ThemeData(
                  primarySwatch: Colors.blue,
                  brightness:
                      store.useDarkMode ? Brightness.dark : Brightness.light,
                ),
                routes: {
                  '/': (_) => ExampleList(),
                }..addEntries(
                    examples.map((ex) => MapEntry(ex.path, ex.widgetBuilder))),
              ),
            ),
          ));
}
```

Here, the `ProxyProvider` API allows us to declare that `SettingsStore` depends on an instance of the `PreferencesService` class and will ensure the objects are constructed in the appropriate order based on the chain of dependencies.
Note that in this particular example, we have used the `Consumer` widget that is an alternative to using `Provider.of<T>` for retrieving a value. Whilst this adds an additional level of indentation, some may prefer this approach as it's
declarative and assists in building a mental model where a value provided so that can be consumed further down in the widget tree. Furthermore, it facilitates in writing code where dependencies can be more explicit. The following is a widget
that depends on the `SettingsStore`

```dart
class SettingsExample extends StatelessWidget {
  const SettingsExample(this.store);

  final SettingsStore store;

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) => Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: const Text('Settings'),
      ),
      body: Observer(
        builder: (context) => SwitchListTile(
          value: store.useDarkMode,
          title: const Text('Use dark mode'),
          onChanged: (value) {
            store.setDarkMode(value: value);
          },
        ),
      ));
}
```

Using a non-default constructor here allows us to explicitly declare that the `SettingsExample` class depends on the `SettingsStore` for it to function. Some developers may already be familiar with structuring code this way
when working with applications/frameworks that support constructor injection. An instance of the `SettingsStore` is passed through the `Consumer` widget as per the example code below

```dart
...
Example(
    title: 'Settings',
    description: 'Settings for toggling dark mode',
    path: '/settings',
    widgetBuilder: (_) => Consumer<SettingsStore>(
      builder: (_, store, __) => SettingsExample(store),
    ),
  )
...
```

A side effect of this is that writing widget tests become easier as well. Since the widget's dependencies have been made explicit, we could pass mocks (e.g. using the <PubBadge name="mockito" /> package) of said dependencies if required.

### A variety of providers

There are multiple types of `Providers` available in the <PubBadge name="provider" />
package. The ones most relevant and useful to MobX are:

- `Provider` for constructing and disposing objects on the fly. This is good when the object has a fixed lifetime.
- `Provider.value`, a `Provider` constructor for single values, known before hand
- `ProxyProvider` for constructing objects that depend on other objects e.g. a store depending on a service
- `MultiProvider` for passing multiple values
