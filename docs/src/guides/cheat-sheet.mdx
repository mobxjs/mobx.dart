# MobX Cheat Sheet 🚀

MobX has a pretty small API surface and tries to get out of your way as much as possible. Although minimal, there are few concepts you
should be familiar with. This guide is meant to be a crash course in MobX.

## Required Packages

Make sure to have the following packages installed for working effectively with `MobX` and `Flutter`:

1. <PubBadge name={'mobx'} />

The main MobX package that includes `Observables`, `Actions`, and `Reactions`

2. <PubBadge name={'flutter_mobx'} />

Provides the `Observer` widget that auto-renders when the tracked observables change.

3. <PubBadge name={'mobx_codegen'} />

A powerful code-generator that greatly improves the developer experience with MobX. It provides annotations like
`@observable`, `@computed`, `@action` which hides all the boilerplate in a separately generated file, `*.g.dart`.

These packages should appear in your `pubspec.yaml` like below.

```yaml
dependencies:
  mobx: ^0.4.0
  flutter_mobx: ^0.3.6
  mobx_codegen: ^0.4.1
```

## Declaring a Store class

Every store in MobX should be declared with the following boilerplate. This is probably the only boilerplate that
gets repeated. You could make this into a code-snippet in your IDE. Below, we are declaring a `Todo` store.

```dart
// todo.dart
import 'package:mobx/mobx.dart';

part 'todo.g.dart';

class Todo = _Todo with _$Todo;

abstract class _Todo with Store {
  /* rest of the class*/
}
```

> Note that the basename of the _part-file_ must match the _containing-file_ exactly! In the above case, the part
> file is called `todo.g.dart`, which matches the `todo.dart` file in which it is contained. To generate the _part-file_,
> you have to run the following command:
>
> ```
> flutter packages pub run build_runner watch --delete-conflicting-outputs
> ```
>
> Ya, it looks like a mouthful 🙃 but it does the job!

## Adding @observable, @computed, @action

_Observables_ are the reactive state of your store and _Actions_ are semantic operations that mutate them. _Computed
Observables_ are read-only properties that depend on other observables and auto-update when any of the dependent
observables change.

```dart
// contact.dart
import 'package:mobx/mobx.dart';

part 'contact.g.dart';

class Contact = _Contact with _$Contact;

abstract class _Contact with Store {
  // highlight-next-line
  @observable
  String firstName;

  // highlight-next-line
  @observable
  String lastName;

  // highlight-next-line
  @computed
  String get fullName() => '$firstName, $lastName';

  ObservableList<String> phoneNumbers = ObservableList.of([]);

  // highlight-next-line
  @action
  void addPhone(String phone) {
    phoneNumbers.add(phone);
  }

  // async action
  // highlight-next-line
  @action
  Future<void> fetchPhoneNumbers() async {
    final numbers = await contactService.fetchFor(firstName, lastName);
    phoneNumbers = ObservableList.of(numbers);
  }
}

```

## Reactive wrappers

MobX also comes with a set of wrapper-classes that add the reactive behavior. These include:

- `ObservableList<T>`
- `ObservableSet<T>`
- `ObservableMap<K,V>`
- `ObservableFuture<T>`
- `ObservableStream<T>`

> ### Reactive Extensions
>
> You can convert plain `List`, `Map`, `Set`, `Future` and `Stream` instances into an observable version with the `asObservable()` extension method.
> For example, in the code-snippet above, you could do:
>
> ```dart
> ObservableList<String> phoneNumbers = [].asObservable();
> ```

## Don't underestimate the @computed

Although `@computed` looks like a simple, readonly observable, it can easily be your most powerful tool.
By creating `@computed` properties that depend on other observables, you can dramatically simplify the UI code and
eliminate most of the business logic inside your Widgets. It is most often used for hiding conditional logic and
calculating some derived information.

For example, rather than checking if some data is loaded successfully inside a Widget...

```dart
Widget build(BuildContext context) {
  final store = Provider.of<Contact>(context);

  return Observer(
      builder: (_) {
  // highlight-start
        if (store.loadOperation != null &&
            store.loadOperation.status == FutureStatus.fulfilled) {
  // highlight-end
          return ContactView(store);
        }

        return Container();
      }
  );
}
```

...you can create a `@computed` property called `hasResults`...

```dart
class _Contact with Store {
  /* rest of the class */

  @observable ObservableFuture<void> loadOperation = null;

  @computed
  // highlight-start
  bool get hasResults =>
      loadOperation != null &&
      loadOperation.status == FutureStatus.fulfilled;
  // highlight-end
}
```

...and simplify your widget logic...

```dart
Widget build(BuildContext context) {
  final store = Provider.of<Contact>(context);

  return Observer(
      builder: (_) {
  // highlight-next-line
        if (store.hasResults) {
          return ContactView(store);
        }

        return Container();
      }
  );
}

```

...Since a `@computed` property is an observable, the `Observer` will automatically render when it changes!

## Adding reactions

_Reactions_, as the name suggests, react to changes in observables. Without reactions, it would be a boring system
that only produces changes in _observables_ but nothing visible or useful ever happens because there are no reactions!

There are 3 types of reactions: `autorun`, `reaction`, `when`. Each reaction returns a `ReactionDisposer`, which when called will dispose
the reaction. Disposing a reaction stops tracking the observables.

- `autorun`: Is a long-running reaction and starts tracking immediately.

```dart
// example.dart

import 'package:mobx/mobx.dart';
part 'example.g.dart';

class Counter = _Counter with _$Counter;

abstract class _Counter with Store {
  @observable int counter = 0;

  void setupReactions() {
    autorun((_){
      print("Count is $counter");
    });
  }

}

```

- `reaction`: Is a long-running reaction and starts tracking only after the first change. It runs the _effect_ when
  any tracked observables change.

```dart
// example.dart

import 'package:mobx/mobx.dart';
part 'example.g.dart';

class Counter = _Counter with _$Counter;

abstract class _Counter with Store {
  @observable int counter = 0;

  void setupReactions() {
    reaction((_) => counter, (int newValue){
      print("Count is now $newValue");
    });
  }

}


```

- `when`: a reaction that waits for a condition to become true before running the _effect_.
