# Build Output

This list gives you some tips to control and manage the generated files coming out of the `build_runner`.

## Use the correct SDK version

The version of the `sdk` used in the `pubspec.yaml` has a big influence on what packages are downloaded as part of the `pub get` command. Make sure you are using at least **`2.1.0-dev`**.

## Continuous generation with the `watch` command

As you work on your stores, you would want to keep the `build_runner` active, constantly generating the `*.g.dart` files. The trick to keep it running is to use the **`watch`** sub-command, as shown below:

```
flutter packages pub run build_runner watch
```

OR

```
pub run build_runner watch
```

## Starting a clean build

Sometimes `build_runner` will simply refuse to run the build if you already have some generated files. This could happen if the version of **dart** or **flutter** has changed. In those case, it is best to start clean and regenerate all the files. You can either use the `clean` sub-command or simply start off by deleting the existing generated files.

- Clean and remove all generated files

```
flutter packages pub run build_runner clean
```

- Delete conflicting files

```
flutter packages pub run build_runner watch --delete-conflicting-outputs
```

## DO NOT use import aliases inside `Store` classes

Inside your `Store` files, **avoid** using types with **import aliases**. This is due to a limitation with `build_runner` that does not pick the aliases for the imports.

For example, if you have a `simple_store.dart` file, where an `@observable` field _(lines 9-10)_ is using the aliased import, `build_runner` will not generate correctly and cause compile errors.

```dart
import 'package:mobx/mobx.dart';
import 'package:example_flutter/models/event.dart' as model;

part 'simple_store.g.dart';

class SimpleStore = _SimpleStore with _$SimpleStore;

abstract class _SimpleStore with Store {
  @observable
  List<model.Event> events = List();
}
```

It's best to avoid import aliases inside the `Store` class. Possibly in a future version, this will be fixed.

## Wrap `dart:ui` types to avoid code-gen issues

Types from `dart:ui` are not resolved by the `source_gen` package, which is internally used by `mobx_codegen`. This causes compile issues when working with those types. But worry not, there is a workaround. If you are curious, why this glitch?, there is an esoteric reason for it:

> Code-generators do not use Dart from the Flutter SDK. They use Dart from the Server SDK. The one with `dart:mirror` but no `dart:ui`. So any type from `dart:ui` won't resolve.

To circumvent this issue, there is a workaround. Just wrap the `dart:ui` type with `CustomXXX` type. The classic example is when `mobx_codegen` fails for the `Color` type from `dart:ui`. We can work around this issue with the following wrapper type:

```dart
class CustomColor extends Color {
  CustomColor(int value) : super(value);
}
```

Yes, we need a constructor here since `Color` does not have an arg-less constructor.

We can now use this type with our observable values, like below. With this change, code-gen will produce the correct code in `*.g.dart` file.

```dart
part 'color_store.g.dart';

class ColorStore = _ColorStore with _$ColorStore;
abstract class _ColorStore with Store {
  
  @observable
  CustomColor selectedColor;
  
  @observable
  ObservableList<CustomColor> palette;
}
```

Anywhere you want to use an observable value that has a type from `dart:ui`, make sure to wrap it to avoid code-gen issues.
