# Observables

Observables form the _reactive state_ of your MobX Application. You can use the API directly or rely on annotations to make it easier. The reactive state of your application can be divided into the **Core State** and **Derived State**. Core State is the state inherent to your business domain, where as Derived State is state that can be derived from the Core State.

> **Reactive State** = **Core-State** + **Derived-State**

<img src={coreDerivedStateImage} />

As you can tell from the image above, the Derived-State is almost always read-only. In the MobX parlance, derived-state is also called _computed properties_, or just _computeds_.

The derived state can be much bigger than the core-state. This is understandable as the number of variations in which the core-state can be visualized can keep increasing over time. All of these are projections from the core-state. For example, the same list of items can be visualized as the raw list, a table, chart or some custom visualization. The view-specific data can be _**derived**_ from the same _core-state_.

## Observable

### `Observable(T initialValue, {String name, ReactiveContext context})`

- **`T initialValue`**: the initial value for the `Observable` or `null` otherwise.
- **`String name`**: a name to identify during debugging
- **`ReactiveContext context`**: the context to which this observable is bound. By default, all observables are bound to the singleton `mainContext` of the application.

An `Observable` is used to track a single value, either primitive or complex. Whenever it changes value, it will fire a notification so that all connected reactions will re-execute.

```dart
final counter = Observable(0); // intially 0

final list = Observable<List<Todo>>(); // start with an initialValue of null
```

If you use a `Store` class, you could do the following to annotate observable properties of the class:

```dart
import 'package:mobx/mobx.dart';

part 'todo.g.dart';

class Todo = _Todo with _$Todo;

abstract class _Todo with Store {
  _Todo(this.description);

  @observable
  String description = '';

  @observable
  bool done = false;

  @action
  void markDone(bool flag) {
    done = flag;
  }
}
```

## Computed

### `Computed(T Function() fn, {String name, ReactiveContext context})`

- **`T Function() fn`**: the function which relies on observables to compute its value.
- **`String name`**: a name to identify during debugging
- **`ReactiveContext context`**: the context to which this computed is bound. By default, all computeds are bound to the singleton `mainContext` of the application.

**Computeds** form the derived state of your application. They depend on other observables or computeds for their value. Any time the depending observables change, they will recompute their new value. Computeds are also smart and **cache** their previous value. Only when the computed-value is different than the cached-value, will they fire notifications. This behavior is key to ensure the connected reactions don't execute unnecessarily.

```dart
final first = Observable('Pavan');
final last = Observable('Podila');

final fullName = Computed(() => '${first.value} ${last.value}');

print(fullName.value); // Pavan Podila

runInAction(() => first.value = 'Siri');

print(fullName.value); // Siri Podila
```

With **annotations**, this can become easier to use:

```dart
part 'todo_list.g.dart';

class Contact = _Contact with _$Contact;

abstract class _Contact with Store {
  @observable
  String first = 'Pavan';

  @observable
  String last = 'Podila';

  @computed
  String get fullName => '${first} ${last}';

}
```

## ObservableList

### `ObservableList({ReactiveContext context})`

- **`ReactiveContext context`**: the context to which this list is bound. By default, all `ObservableList`s are bound to the singleton `mainContext` of the application.

An `ObservableList` gives you a deeper level of observability on a list of values. It tracks when items are added, removed or modified and notifies the observers. Use an `ObservableList` when a change in the list matters. You can couple this with the `@observable` annotation to also track when the list reference changes, eg: going from `null` to a list with values.

## ObservableMap

### `ObservableMap({ReactiveContext context})`

- **`ReactiveContext context`**: the context to which this map is bound. By default, all `ObservableMap`s are bound to the singleton `mainContext` of the application.

An `ObservableMap` gives you a deeper level of observability on a map of values. It tracks when keys are added, removed or modified and notifies the observers. Use an `ObservableMap` when a change in the map matters. You can couple this with the `@observable` annotation to also track when the map reference changes, eg: going from `null` to a map with values.

## ObservableSet

### `ObservableSet({ReactiveContext context})`

- **`ReactiveContext context`**: the context to which this set is bound. By default, all `ObservableSet`s are bound to the singleton `mainContext` of the application.

An `ObservableSet` gives you a deeper level of observability on a set of values. It tracks when values are added, removed or modified and notifies the observers. Use an `ObservableSet` when a change in the set matters. You can couple this with the `@observable` annotation to also track when the set reference changes, eg: going from `null` to a set with values.

## ObservableFuture

### `ObservableFuture(Future<T> future, {ReactiveContext context})`

- **`Future<T> future`**: The future that is tracked for status changes.
- **`ReactiveContext context`**: the context to which this observable-future is bound. By default, all `ObservableFuture`s are bound to the singleton `mainContext` of the application.

The `ObservableFuture` is the reactive wrapper around a `Future`. You can use it to show the UI under various states of a `Future`, from `pending` to `fulfilled` or `rejected`. The `status`, `result` and `error` fields of an `ObservableFuture` are observable and can be consumed on the UI.

Here is a simple `LoadingIndicator` widget that uses the `ObservableFuture` to show a progress bar during a fetch operation:

```dart

// github_store.dart
part 'github_store.g.dart';

class GithubStore = _GithubStore with _$GithubStore;

abstract class _GithubStore with Store {
  // ...

  static ObservableFuture<List<Repository>> emptyResponse =
      ObservableFuture.value([]);

  // We are starting with an empty future to avoid a null check
  @observable
  ObservableFuture<List<Repository>> fetchReposFuture = emptyResponse;

  // ...
}

// github_widgets.dart
class LoadingIndicator extends StatelessWidget {
  const LoadingIndicator(this.store);

  final GithubStore store;

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) => Observer(
      builder: (_) => store.fetchReposFuture.status == FutureStatus.pending
          ? const LinearProgressIndicator()
          : Container());
}

```

## ObservableStream

### `ObservableStream(Stream<T> stream, {T initialValue, bool cancelOnError, ReactiveContext context})`

- **`Stream<T> stream`**: The stream that is tracked for `status` and `value` changes.
- **`T initialValue`**: The starting value of the stream.
- **`bool cancelOnError`**: Should the stream be cancelled on error. Default is set to `false`.
- **`ReactiveContext context`**: the context to which this observable-stream is bound. By default, all `ObservableStream`s are bound to the singleton `mainContext` of the application.

Similar to `ObservableFuture`, an **`ObservableStream`** provides a reactive wrapper around a `Stream`. This gives an easy way to observe and re-render whenever there is new `data`, or `error` or a `status` change on the `ObservableStream`.

## Atom

An `Atom` is at the core of the MobX reactivity system. It tracks when it is observed and notifies whenever it changes. Note that an Atom does not store any value. That is the responsibility of the `Observable`, which extends `Atom` to add the storage. You would rarely need to use an Atom directly. Instead, depend on an `Observable` for most use-cases.

> **Aside**
>
> The **`mobx_codegen`** package uses an `Atom` internally for all the `@observable` annotated fields.

### Atomic Clock

Here is a simple clock that relies on an `Atom` to notify every second.

> Full code can be seen [here](https://github.com/mobxjs/mobx.dart/tree/master/mobx_examples/lib/clock).

- When the clock gets observed the first time, we start the timer (`_startTimer`).
- When the clock is no longer observed (eg: when a reaction is disposed), we dispose off the timer (`_stopTimer`).
- In each tick of the timer, we call `_atom.reportChanged()`. This notifies the MobX reactive system that the atom has changed value and all connected reactions should be re-executed.
- When the `now` property is read the first time, the clock gets observed and starts ticking. It also fires the `_atom.reportObserved()` to make MobX start tracking this atom.

```dart
import 'dart:async';

import 'package:mobx/mobx.dart';

class Clock {
  Clock() {
    _atom = Atom(
        name: 'Clock Atom', onObserved: _startTimer, onUnobserved: _stopTimer);
  }

  DateTime get now {
    _atom.reportObserved();
    return DateTime.now();
  }

  Atom _atom;
  Timer _timer;

  void _startTimer() {
    print('Clock started ticking');

    if (_timer != null) {
      _timer.cancel();
    }

    _timer = Timer.periodic(Duration(seconds: 1), _onTick);
  }

  void _stopTimer() {
    if (_timer != null) {
      _timer.cancel();
    }

    print('Clock stopped ticking');
  }

  void _onTick(_) {
    _atom.reportChanged();
  }
}

```
