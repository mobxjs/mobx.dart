# Getting Started ðŸš€

In this tutorial you will learn how to create a MobX version of the default Flutter "counter" app.

import finalImage from './end-result.png';

<img
  src={finalImage}
  alt="End Result of the MobX-based Counter app"
  width={300}
/>

## Prepare

1. Before starting this tutorial make sure you have [flutter installed](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install) and know how to [create a new flutter project](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/test-drive).
2. Create a new flutter project on your computer to start.

## Install Dependencies

Add the following **dependencies** to your `pubspec.yaml` file.

```yaml
dependencies:
  mobx: ^1.0.0
  flutter_mobx: ^1.0.0
```

Next add the following **dev_dependencies**:

```yaml
dev_dependencies:
  build_runner: ^1.7.2
  mobx_codegen: ^1.0.0
```

In your project folder, run this command to fetch all the packages:

```
flutter packages get
```

At this point you should have all the necessary packages to continue development.

## Add a Store

Now, let's create a MobX store. A store in MobX is a way of collecting the related observable state under one class. The store allows us to use annotations and keeps the code simple. Create a new file `counter.dart` in **`\lib`** folder and add the following code to it.

```dart
import 'package:mobx/mobx.dart';

// Include generated file
part 'counter.g.dart';

// This is the class used by rest of your codebase
class Counter = _Counter with _$Counter;

// The store-class
abstract class _Counter with Store {
  @observable
  int value = 0;

  @action
  void increment() {
    value++;
  }
}
```

The interesting parts here are:

- The abstract class `_Counter` that includes the `Store` mixin. All of your store-related code should be placed inside this abstract class. We create a `Counter` class to blend in the code from the `build_runner`.
- The generated code will be inside the part file: `counter.g.dart`, which we include with the _`part` directive_. Without this, the `build_runner` will not produce any output. The generated file contains the `_$Counter` mixin.

> #### Note
>
> It is essential to use proper casing for the file name, else the `build_runner` **will not** generate any output.
> Since our file is called `counter.dart`, the part file must be named as `counter.g.dart` (note the lowercase letters)

- The `@observable` annotation to mark the `value` as observable.
- Use of `@action` to mark the `increment()` method as an action.

Run the following command inside your project folder. This generates the code in `counter.g.dart`, which we have already included as part file.

```
flutter packages pub run build_runner build
```

On the command-line, here's the output we got from running it. Yours might be slightly different.

```
âžœ  [mobx_getting_started]> flutter packages pub run build_runner build

```

> ### Stay on watch
>
> If you are making changes to the store and want to generate `*.g.dart` files automatically, you can use the following command:

> ```
> flutter packages pub run build_runner watch
> ```
>
> ### Starting Clean
>
> Sometimes you may have an error running this command due to existing files, possibly generated from an earlier version of
> `build_runner`. In that case, you can add the following flag to delete the `*.g.dart` files before generating them.
>
> ```
> flutter packages pub run build_runner watch --delete-conflicting-outputs
> ```

## Connect the Store and add an Observer to your Widget

Now comes the part where we connect the MobX store to the Widget. In your `main.dart` file, replace the code with the following:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_mobx/flutter_mobx.dart';

import 'counter.dart'; // Import the Counter

final counter = Counter(); // Instantiate the store

void main() => runApp(MyApp());

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  // This widget is the root of your application.
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'MobX',
      theme: ThemeData(
        primarySwatch: Colors.blue,
      ),
      home: const MyHomePage(),
    );
  }
}

class MyHomePage extends StatelessWidget {
  const MyHomePage();

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('MobX Counter'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: Column(
          mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
          children: <Widget>[
            Text(
              'You have pushed the button this many times:',
            ),
            // Wrapping in the Observer will automatically re-render on changes to counter.value
            Observer(
              builder: (_) => Text(
                    '${counter.value}',
                    style: Theme.of(context).textTheme.display1,
                  ),
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
      floatingActionButton: FloatingActionButton(
        onPressed: counter.increment,
        tooltip: 'Increment',
        child: Icon(Icons.add),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

You will notice above that we have not used any `StatefulWidget` instances! The state is stored in the `Counter` store and the `Observer` widget reads the `counter.value` to render the count. Just the simple act of reading the `counter.value` is enough for the `Observer` to start tracking and re-render on changes.

## And we are done!

Our end result will look exactly the same as our start! As you tap on the `FloatingActionButton`, the counter will increment and update automatically.

import endResult from './mobx-counter.gif';

<img src={endResult} width={300} />
