title: MobX versus Inherited Model
---

`MobX` and [`InheritedModel`](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/widgets/InheritedModel-class.html) are both state management solutions for Flutter apps, but they have different strengths and weaknesses.

**`MobX` is a more complex library, but it offers a number of advantages over InheritedModel, including:**

- Reactivity: MobX uses a reactive programming model, which means that changes to state are automatically reflected in the UI. This can simplify your code and make it easier to maintain.
- Centralized state management: MobX allows you to manage all of your app's state in one place, which can make it easier to debug and reason about your code.
- Performance: MobX is highly optimized and can provide significant performance benefits for complex apps.

**`InheritedModel` is a simpler library, but it also has some limitations:**

- Manual updates: InheritedModel does not automatically update the UI when state changes. You must manually call the notifyListeners() method to notify the UI of changes.
- Decentralized state management: InheritedModel is a decentralized state management solution. This means that state can be scattered throughout your app, which can make it difficult to debug and reason about.
- Performance: InheritedModel can be less performant than MobX for complex apps.

### When to use MobX:

- You are building a complex app with a lot of state.
- You want to use a reactive programming model.
- You want to centralize state management.
- You need high performance.


### When to use InheritedModel:

- You are building a simple app with a little bit of state.
- You want to use a decentralized state management solution.
- You need a simple solution that is easy to learn and use.
- You are not concerned about performance.


### Which one should you use?

It depends on your specific needs. If you are building a complex app with a lot of state, you should use MobX. If you are building a simple app with a little bit of state, you can use InheritedModel.

### Can the Inherited Model completely replace MobX?

Yes, the Inherited Model can completely replace MobX. However, it is important to note that the Inherited Model is a more manual solution. You will need to manually update the UI when state changes, and you will need to manage state yourself.

If you are looking for a more powerful and automated state management solution, then MobX is a better choice. However, if you need a simple solution that is easy to learn and use, then the Inherited Model is a good option.
