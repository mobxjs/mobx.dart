title: Release Guidelines
---

If you are a developer on the MobX project, here are few guidelines that will
help in your journey. These apply to all the packages: `mobx`, `mobx_codegen`,
`flutter_mobx`.

### 1. Format your code

To format your files following
[Dart guidelines](https://dart.dev/guides/language/effective-dart/style#formatting).
This will format your code accordingly regardless of your IDE settings.

```
dartfmt -w .
```

### 2. pubspec.yaml

- Use the [semantic versioning policy](https://dart.dev/tools/pub/versioning) to
  update the version in `pubspec.yaml`.
- Say you are updating from `0.1.0` to `0.2.0`, then update the `version` field
  in `pubspec.yaml`:

```yaml
version: 0.2.0
```

### 3. Expose version

- Expose the updated version of `pubspec.yaml` to the library by running the
  following command in each package. This will run this command in each of the
  package folders.

```bash
melos run set_version
```

> This requires you to have the `melos` package installed globally. Install it
> using:`shelldart pub global activate melos`> ```

### 4. Changelog

- Update the `CHANGELOG.md` file to include the changes introduced in the new
  version. Normally, you would do this by adding a new bullet point for the
  version and follow the template from earlier versions.
- If the changes are minimal, you can also append the change to an earlier
  bullet point but include the new version as a range. For example, the changes
  in `0.3.2+3` were minimal, so we added it as a range from the earlier version.

```markdown
## 0.3.0 - 0.3.2+3
```

### 5. Git Push

And that's it! The rest of the work will be automatically done by
[Github Actions](https://github.com/mobxjs/mobx.dart/actions). The Build and
Publish workflow will inspect the local and remote versions of the package and
publish to `pub.dev` if newer. It will also tag the commit with the right tags
following the format of: `<package-name>-<version-number>`
