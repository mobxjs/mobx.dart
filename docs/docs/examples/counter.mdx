title: Counter
description: The Counter example
---

This example is the same as the one in the [Getting Started](/getting-started) guide. It does add a few details that were missing over there.

> See the complete code [here](https://github.com/mobxjs/mobx.dart/tree/master/mobx_examples/lib/counter).

## Create the store

Our `Counter` store is fairly simple, as seen below. Since we are using annotations, we have:

- [x] included the part file `counter.g.dart`. This is generated by `build_runner`.
- [x] created the abstract class `CounterBase` that includes the `Store` mixin
- [x] created the class `Counter` that blends `CounterBase` with the mixin `_$Counter`. The mixin is defined in the _generated part file_.

```dart
import 'package:mobx/mobx.dart';

part 'counter.g.dart';

class Counter = CounterBase with _$Counter;

abstract class CounterBase with Store {
  @observable
  int value = 0;

  @action
  void increment() {
    value++;
  }
}

```

The above store defines a single _observable_ `value`. The action-method `increment()` is used to increment the `value`. Using actions gives you a _**semantic**_ way of invoking _mutating operations_ on the _observable state_.

## Connect the Widget

Now that our model for the `Store` is ready, we can focus on bringing it to life with a `Widget`. Let's create an instance of our store:

```dart
final Counter counter = Counter();
```

Next we create a simple `StatefulWidget` that renders the count and exposes the _Increment_ button.
To make the count automatically update on changes, we wrap the `Text` widget inside an `Observer` widget.
Any observable that gets used in the `builder` function of `Observer` is automatically tracked.
When it changes, `Observer` re-renders by calling the `builder` again.
This can be seen in the highlighted code below.

```dart
class CounterExample extends StatefulWidget {
  const CounterExample();

  @override
  CounterExampleState createState() => CounterExampleState();
}

class CounterExampleState extends State<CounterExample> {
  final Counter counter = Counter();

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) => Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          backgroundColor: Colors.blue,
          title: const Text('MobX Counter'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: Column(
            mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
            children: <Widget>[
              const Text(
                'You have pushed the button this many times:',
              ),
              // highlight-start
              Observer(
                  builder: (_) => Text(
                        '${counter.value}',
                        style: const TextStyle(fontSize: 40),
                      )),
              // highlight-end
            ],
          ),
        ),
        floatingActionButton: FloatingActionButton(
          onPressed: counter.increment,
          tooltip: 'Increment',
          child: const Icon(Icons.add),
        ),
      );
}

```
