## Observer Widget

#### `Observer({required Widget Function(BuildContext context) builder})`

One of the most visual reactions in the app is the UI. The **Observer** widget (which is part of the <PubBadge name="flutter_mobx" /> package),
provides a granular observer of the observables used in its `builder` function.
Whenever these observables change, `Observer` rebuilds and renders.

> ### Immediate context for `builder`

The key thing to note is that the `builder` function will only track the observables in its immediate execution context. If an observable

> is being used in a nested function, it will not be tracked. Make sure to dereference (a.k.a. read) an observable in the immediate
> execution context. If no observables are found when running the `builder` function, it will warn you on the console.

This is one of the most common gotchas when using MobX. Just because you have nested functions inside a `builder`, which are reading

> an observable, it does not actually track the observable. It can appear deceiving but the fact is, the observable was not in the
> **immediate execution context**. Be watchful for this scenario, especially when your `Observer`-wrapped `Widgets` are not updating properly.

Below is the _Counter_ example in its entirety.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_mobx/flutter_mobx.dart';
import 'package:mobx/mobx.dart';

part 'counter.g.dart';

class Counter = CounterBase with _$Counter;

abstract class CounterBase with Store {
  @observable
  int value = 0;

  @action
  void increment() {
    value++;
  }
}

class CounterExample extends StatefulWidget {
  const CounterExample({Key key}) : super(key: key);

  @override
  _CounterExampleState createState() => _CounterExampleState();
}

class _CounterExampleState extends State<CounterExample> {
  final _counter = Counter();

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) => Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: const Text('Counter'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: Column(
            mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
            children: <Widget>[
              const Text(
                'You have pushed the button this many times:',
              ),
              Observer(
                  builder: (_) => Text(
                        '${_counter.value}',
                        style: const TextStyle(fontSize: 20),
                      )),
            ],
          ),
        ),
        floatingActionButton: FloatingActionButton(
          onPressed: _counter.increment,
          tooltip: 'Increment',
          child: const Icon(Icons.add),
        ),
      );
}
```

## ReactionBuilder widget

If you ever ran into a need for running a reaction when a Widget loads, you most likely created a `StatefulWidget`
and put your reaction in the `initState()`.

This forces you to make a wrapper widget, whose sole purpose is to run the
reaction and dispose it as part of the `dispose()` method. Rather that doing that ceremony everytime, there is a simpler
way of handling this with the `ReactionBuilder`.

#### `ReactionBuilder({required ReactionDisposer Function(BuildContext context) builder, required Widget child})`

Here is a snippet from the [ConnectivityExample](/examples/connectivity):

```dart

class ConnectivityExample extends StatelessWidget {
  const ConnectivityExample(this.store, {Key? key}) : super(key: key);

  final ConnectivityStore store;

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) => ScaffoldMessenger(
// highlight-start
        child: ReactionBuilder(
            builder: (context) {
              return reaction((_) => store.connectivityStream.value, (result) {
                final messenger = ScaffoldMessenger.of(context);

                messenger.showSnackBar(SnackBar(
                    content: Text(result == ConnectivityResult.none
                        ? 'You\'re offline'
                        : 'You\'re online')));
              }, delay: 4000);
            },
// highlight-end
            child: Scaffold(
              appBar: AppBar(
                title: const Text('Settings'),
              ),
              body: const Padding(
                padding: EdgeInsets.all(16),
                child: Text(
                    'Turn your connection on/off for approximately 4 seconds to see the app respond to changes in your connection status.'),
              ),
            )),
      );
}

```

Notice the use of the `ReactionBuilder` that sets up the reaction in the `builder()` method.

This simplifies the outer widget and keeps it as a `StatelessWidget`.
Without the `ReactionBuilder`, you would have to create a wrapper `StatefulWidget`, prepare the reaction in the `initState()` and then dispose it in the `dispose()` of the widget.

Use the `ReactionBuilder` to keep your UI tree as a set of `StatelessWidgets`.
