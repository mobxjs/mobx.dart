The **MobX triad** is completed when we add **Reactions** into the mix. Having reactions is what triggers the reactivity in the system. A reaction implicitly tracks all the observables which are being used and then re-executes its logic whenever the depending observables change.

> Technically, a computed is also a reaction, aka **Derivation**, as it depends on other observables or computeds. The only difference between a regular `Reaction` and `Computed` is that the former does not produce any value. Computeds are mostly read-only observables that derive their value from other observables.

Reactions, or Derivations come in few flavors: `autorun`, `reaction`, `when` and of course the Flutter Widget: `Observer`. All of these variations take a function that is tracked for any observables. When the tracked observables change, the function is re-executed. This simple behavior is the defining characteristic of a reaction. Note that there is no explicit subscription or wiring needed. Reactions also return a _disposer-function_ (`ReactionDisposer`) that can be invoked to pre-maturely dispose a reaction.

## autorun

#### `ReactionDisposer autorun(Function(Reaction) fn)`

Runs the reaction immediately and also on any change in the observables used inside
`fn`.

```dart
import 'package:mobx/mobx.dart';

final greeting = Observable('Hello World');

final dispose = autorun((_){
  print(greeting.value);
});

greeting.value = 'Hello MobX';

// Done with the autorun()
dispose();


// Prints:
// Hello World
// Hello MobX
```

## reaction

#### `ReactionDisposer reaction<T>(T Function(Reaction) fn, void Function(T) effect)`

Monitors the observables used inside the `fn()` tracking function and runs the `effect()` when
the tracking function returns a different value. Only the observables inside `fn()` are tracked.

```dart
import 'package:mobx/mobx.dart';

final greeting = Observable('Hello World');

final dispose = reaction((_) => greeting.value, (msg) => print(msg));

greeting.value = 'Hello MobX'; // Cause a change

// Done with the reaction()
dispose();


// Prints:
// Hello MobX
```

## when

#### `ReactionDisposer when(bool Function(Reaction) predicate, void Function() effect)`

Monitors the observables used inside `predicate()` and runs the `effect()` _when_ it returns `true`. After the `effect()` is run, `when` automatically disposes itself. So you can think of _when_ as a _one-time_ `reaction`. You can also dispose `when()` pre-maturely.

```dart
import 'package:mobx/mobx.dart';

final greeting = Observable('Hello World');

final dispose = when((_) => greeting.value == 'Hello MobX', () => print('Someone greeted MobX'));

greeting.value = 'Hello MobX'; // Causes a change, runs effect and disposes


// Prints:
// Someone greeted MobX
```

## asyncWhen

#### `Future<void> asyncWhen(bool Function(Reaction) predicate)`

Similar to `when` but returns a `Future`, which is fulfilled when the `predicate()` returns _true_. This is a convenient way of waiting for the `predicate()` to turn `true`.

```dart
final completed = Observable(false);

void waitForCompletion() async {
  await asyncWhen(() => completed.value == true);

  print('Completed');
}
```
