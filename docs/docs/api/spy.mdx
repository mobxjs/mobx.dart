description: Spy exposes the internal workings of MobX and gives a deeper look into the reactive system.
---

MobX so far has been somewhat of a black-box, nicely hiding the details of how its reactive system works internally. Some have seen this as "too much magic" and not sure of how/why things work. The problem exacerbates when you have runtime exceptions. The amount of detail exposed on the error may not be enough. It also lacks the complete trace of events that led to the failure.

**Spying** exposes all these details and shows what is happening inside MobX. It can be summarized like so:

- It gives better visibility of MobX internals
- Enables better developer experience while debugging
- Paves the way for integrating with other tools

import spy from '../../src/images/spy.png';

## Let us Spy

Using the `spy()` method of a `ReactiveContext`, you can get notified of all activities happening inside MobX. Most of the time you are dealing with the `mainContext`, so you could just do:

```dart {7}
import 'package:mobx/mobx.dart';

void main() {

  // ...

  mainContext.spy((event) { /* ... */ });

  runApp(MyApp());
}
```

In this case, we are setting up a spy right in the top-level `main()` method. This gives us visibility into MobX, right from the get-go.

### `ReactiveContext.spy()`

```dart {1}
Dispose spy(SpyListener listener);

typedef Dispose = void Function();
typedef SpyListener = void Function(SpyEvent event);

```

Setting up a spy gives you a disposer that can be called anytime to turn-off. This is useful if you want to specifically setup a spy around an action, observable or reaction. The details are present in `SpyEvent`, which are more specifically captured in its sub-classes:

- `ObservableValueSpyEvent`
- `ComputedValueSpyEvent`
- `ReactionSpyEvent`
- `ReactionErrorSpyEvent`
- `ReactionDisposedSpyEvent`
- `ActionSpyEvent`
- `EndedSpyEvent`

## Simple logging

Let us setup the spy to do some logging of the MobX activities.

> This is part of the [mobx_examples code](https://github.com/mobxjs/mobx.dart/blob/master/mobx_examples/lib/main.dart#L26).

```dart {7}
import 'package:mobx/mobx.dart';

Future<void> main() async {

  // ...

  mainContext.spy(print);

  runApp(MyApp());
}
```

Running the counter example in the simulator gives the following output:

import counterSpy from '../../src/images/mobx-counter-spy.png';

<img src={counterSpy} width={300} />

```{1,5,6,9,13}
flutter: reaction(START) Observer
#3      CounterExampleState.build (package:mobx_examples/counter/counter_widgets.dart:28:15)
flutter: reaction(END after 0ms) Observer
#3      CounterExampleState.build (package:mobx_examples/counter/counter_widgets.dart:28:15)
flutter: action(START) _Counter.increment
flutter: observable(START) _Counter.value=1, previously=0
flutter: observable(END) _Counter.value
flutter: action(END after 1ms) _Counter.increment
flutter: reaction(START) Observer
#3      CounterExampleState.build (package:mobx_examples/counter/counter_widgets.dart:28:15)
flutter: reaction(END after 0ms) Observer
#3      CounterExampleState.build (package:mobx_examples/counter/counter_widgets.dart:28:15)
flutter: reaction-dispose Observer
#3      CounterExampleState.build (package:mobx_examples/counter/counter_widgets.dart:28:15)
```

Looking at this log, we can trace the events that led to the new state:

1. The `Observer` **(reaction)** is setup.
2. When we tap on the **Increment** button, the `_Counter.increment` **(action)** gets fired.
3. As part of that action, the `_Counter.value` **(observable)** gets updated from **0** to **1**.
4. Since the `_Counter.value` has changed, the `Observer` gets rebuilt, resulting in displaying the new value.
5. Once we leave the Counter example, the `Observer` reaction gets disposed.

Even in this simple example, we can see that a trace of events makes the whole process more meaningful. The magic of MobX can now be unraveled with the use of `spy()`!
