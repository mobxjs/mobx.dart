# Todos

In this example, we will build the classic [TodoMVC](http://todomvc.com/), which has become the default way of showcasing the capabilities of a state-management library.

## Creating the Observable state

As you can expect the **Todos** app manages a list of `Todo` items. Each `Todo` can be defined by a simple class like the following. You should now be familiar with the little boilerplate here.

> If the boilerplate seems new, take a look at the [Counter example](/examples/counter)

The `Todo` class should be self-explanatory.

```
class Todo = TodoBase with _$Todo;

abstract class TodoBase implements Store {
  TodoBase(this.description);

  @observable
  String description = '';

  @observable
  bool done = false;
}
```
