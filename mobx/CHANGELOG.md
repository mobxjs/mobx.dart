## 1.1.0 - 1.1.1

- All exceptions caught inside MobX reactions are now reported as `MobXCaughtException`. Previously they were reported as-is and that caused issues in `flutter_mobx`, where the stack traces were not visible. The stack trace is now being captured as part of the exception, so `flutter_mobx` can show the complete trace. This helps a lot during debugging.
- `MobXException` now extends from `Error` to capture the stack trace. This is done because Dart only captures stack traces automatically for `Error` instances.
- Bringing test coverage back to 98% in `1.1.1`

## 1.0.2 - 1.0.2+2

- Added `@StoreConfig` annotation ([@hawkbee1](https://github.com/hawkbee1))
- Fixed to link to pt-BR translation on github
- Fixed anchor link inside README.md

## 1.0.1

- Fix for ObservableMap not adding null values (#417), thanks to @Vardiak

## 1.0.0

- Ready for prime time!

## 0.4.0+3 - 0.4.0+4

- Going back to original `test_coverage` package
- Some cleanups in the tests

## 0.4.0+2

- README updates
- Switching to [Github Actions](https://github.com/mobxjs/mobx.dart/actions) for all builds and publishing

## 0.4.0 - 0.4.0+1

- Removing the deprecated `authors` field from `pubspec.yaml`
- Added extension methods to create an Observable{List,Set,Map,Future,Stream} from a regular List, Set, Map, Future, Stream. Thanks
  to the work done by [Jacob Moura](https://github.com/jacobaraujo7)
- `README.md` translated to Portuguese, thanks to [Jacob Moura](https://github.com/jacobaraujo7)

## 0.3.10

- Removed `Store.dispose`
- Fixed some analyzer errors related to `unused_element`

## 0.3.9+3

- Documentation comments for many of the public methods and classes
- Package updates

## 0.3.9 - 0.3.9+1

- Added `toString` override for `MobXException`
- Added an interface `ObservableValue` that is a common interface for all observables: `Observable`, `Computed`, `ObservableFuture`, `ObservableStream`. Thanks to [@t-artikov](https://github.com/t-artikov)
- Added chat link to Discord. It is now: [![Join the chat at https://discord.gg/dNHY52k](https://img.shields.io/badge/Chat-on%20Discord-lightgrey?style=flat&logo=discord)](https://discord.gg/dNHY52k)

## 0.3.7 - 0.3.8+1

- Fixes the type resolution bug that prevented using types from packages like `dart:ui`
- Fixes the type resolution of other public `Store` classes referenced in the `@store` based generation

Thanks to [@shyndman](https://github.com/shyndman) for the tremendous work on this release.

- Added a version constant that matches the `pubspec.yaml`

## 0.3.6

- Added new way to create `Store` classes using the `@store` annotation. This will exist as an alternative to the mixin based approach we already have.
- Includes a new option for `reaction` for using a custom `EqualityComparator<T, T>`. This is useful when you want to avoid expensive reactions by plugging in a custom comparison function for the _previous_ and _next_ values of the predicate.

## 0.3.5 - 0.3.5+1

- Fixed a bug where the `ObservableFuture<T>` would not show the correct status. This was happening because of the lazy evaluation strategy. We are now being eager in creating the status and monitoring the inner `Future<T>` immediately.
- Upgraded `test_coverage`

## 0.3.3+1 - 0.3.4

- Removed the `@experimental` annotations for `Observable{Future,Stream}` and `reaction`.
- Removed the dependency on the `meta` package.
- Some formatting changes
- Reporting update or change only when the new value is different than the old value. This is mostly for observable collections like list, set, map.

## 0.3.3

- Wrapping all collection setters in conditional action wrappers. This removes the need to wrap collection mutating methods in explicit actions.

## 0.3.0 - 0.3.2+3

- API changes introduced to the `enforceActions` setting of `ReactiveConfig`. It is now called `writePolicy` and the enum `EnforceActions` has been renamed to `ReactiveWritePolicy`.
- Also introducing a `readPolicy` setting on `ReactiveConfig`. It is an enumeration with two values:
- Removing the "strict-mode" text in the exception message when the `ReactiveWritePolicy` is violated. This was a vestige from the `mobx.js` world.
- Exposing a boolean `isWithinBatch` on `ReactiveContext`, which tells if the current code is running inside a batch. This is used to conditionally apply an action-wrapper for `mobx_codegen`-generated setters.
- Introduced an action-wrapper called `conditionallyRunInAction()` that runs the given function in an action only when outside a batch.
- Increasing test coverage

```dart
enum ReactiveReadPolicy { always, never }
```

## 0.2.1+2

- Improving test coverage

## 0.2.1+1

- README updates

## 0.2.1

- An internal change was made to support the new restrictions around [non-covariant type variables in superinterfaces](https://github.com/dart-lang/language/blob/master/accepted/future-releases/contravariant-superinterface-2018/feature-specification.md). This was causing compile errors in the Flutter `beta`/`dev`/`master` channels.

## 0.2.0

- A breaking change has been introduced to the use of the `Store` type. Previously it was meant to be used as an _interface_, which has now changed to a **mixin**. Instead of doing:

```dart
abstract class UserBase implements Store {}
```

You now do:

```dart
abstract class UserBase with Store {}
```

This allows us to add more convenience methods to the `Store` mixin without causing any breaking change in the future. With the current use of the interface, this was not possible and was limiting the purpose. `Store` was just a marker interface without any core functionality. With a **mixin**, it opens up some flexibility in adding more functionality later.

- All the docs and example code have been updated to the use of the `Store` mixin.
