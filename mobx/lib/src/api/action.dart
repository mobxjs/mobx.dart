/// Creates an action that encapsulates all the mutations happening on the
/// observables.
///
/// Wrapping mutations inside an action ensures the depending observers
/// are only notified when the action completes. This is useful to silent the notifications
/// when several observables are being changed together. You will want to run your
/// reactions only when all the mutations complete. This also helps in keeping
/// the state of your application consistent.
///
/// You can give a debug-friendly [name] to identify the action.
///
/// ```
/// var x = Observable(10);
/// var y = Observable(20);
/// var total = Observable(0);
///
/// autorun((){
///   print('x = ${x}, y = ${y}, total = ${total}');
/// });
///
/// var totalUp = action((){
///   x.value++;
///   y.value++;
///
///   total.value = x.value + y.value;
/// }, name: 'adder');
/// ```
/// Even though we are changing 3 observables (`x`, `y` and `total`), the [autorun()]
/// is only executed once. This is the benefit of action. It batches up all the change
/// notifications and propagates them only after the completion of the action. Actions
/// can also be nested inside, in which case the change notification will propagate when
/// the top-level action completes.
